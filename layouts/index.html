  <p class="hero__fact">Fun Fact: This website is a JAMstack site. It’s built using <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> and hosted by <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>. You can find the source code for it on <a href="https://github.com/pav-swies/jamstack-for-beginners">GitHub</a>.</p>

<section class="about wrapper" id="about">
  <h2>What is the JAMstack?</h2>
  <p class="about__description">It’s a way of building a site so that it <span class="underlined">doesn't</span> rely on any web servers or data bases. JAMstack sites are static and pre-built, meaning that they can be served directly from a Content Delivery Network.</p>
  <section class="benefits wrapper-right">
    <h2>Benefits of JAMstack</h2>
    <div class="benefits__card">
      <h3>Speed 🏎</h3>
      <p>Because the sites are static and pre-rendered, loading times are much faster compared to dynamic sites, which require the server to rebuild the site each time it’s opened.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="benefits__card">
      <h3>Security 🔒</h3>
      <p>There are no data bases or servers, therefore there is a much lower chance of a security breach.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="benefits__card">
      <h3>Ease 👌</h3>
      <p>Since there are no servers or data bases, you don’t need to worry about setting them up. Front-end developers no longer need to mess around with the back-end. It’s a much better development experience!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="benefits__card">
      <h3>Cheap 💵</h3>
      <p>Again, ditching servers and data bases means you don’t have to pay for them. Hosting can also be free on CDN services such as Netlify.</p>

    <h2 class="experience__title">A JAMstack site has a static architecture</h2>
    <p class="experience__text">This <span class="underlined">does not</span> mean that the user experience has to be static!</p>
  </div>
</section>
<section class="jam wrapper">
  <div class="jam__inner wrapper-left">
    <h2>Here's what the JAM stands for</h2>
    <div class="jam__card">
      <h3>JavaScript</h3>
      <p class="jam__text">JavaScript is used to add interactivity and other bells and whistles to the site. Since there are no servers, the browser serves as the runtime.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="jam__card">
      <h3>APIs</h3>
      <p class="jam__text">Need to pass in data? No problem. APIs are used for external data access.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="jam__card">
      <h3>Markup</h3>
      <p class="jam__text">Markup files such as Markdown are source files from which the static HTML files can be generated from.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="jam__bottom">
      <div class="point">
        <p class="point__text">!</p>
      </div>
      <p>These technologies enable developers to achieve a dynamic experience on a static website. Keep in mind that a JAMstack site does not need to use all of these. For example, your website doesn’t need to have any JavaScript, it’s optional.</p>

    <h2>Ready to make your own JAMstack site?</h2>
    <h3>Let's get started 🚀</h3>
    <ol class="steps__list">
      <li class="steps__item">
        <h4>Create a static website</h4>
        <p class="steps__p">The first thing you need is a static website. This can be handwritten from the ground up, using a static site generator, or both. The point is that the website is static so that it can be pre-rendered by a CDN.</p>
        <p class="steps__p">I recommend using a Static Site Generator such as Hugo as it adds tons of functionality to your website, and allows you to integrate a CMS into your website later.</p>
        <p class="steps__p">You can discover many more Static Site Generators on staticgen.com. Some are simple and only require simple HTML and CSS skills to get going, and some make use of JavaScript frameworks like React.</p>
      </li>
      <li class="steps__item">
        <h4>Upload your site to a Git repository</h4>
        <p class="steps__p">The CDN will need access to your website so that it can build it. This step can be done at the beginning of creating your website to make use of version control, but it’s not necessary.</p>
        <p class="steps__p">Once you are ready to publish the site with the latest changes, create a new Git repository on a website such as GitHub, then push the files to the repo. If you already have a repo set up for the site, simply push the latest changes. </p>
      </li>
      <li class="steps__item">
        <h4>Link your Git repo to a CDN</h4>
        <p class="steps__p">In the CDN service of your choice, create an account and import your website by connecting the Git repository. I recommend using Netlify as it’s very simple and free.</p>
        <div class="steps__collapsible">
          <div class="steps__collapsible-head">
            <p class="steps__p--heading">Steps on Netlify:</p>
            <button aria-label="View these steps for Netlify" class="steps__collapsible-button" role="button">
              <img class="steps__collapsible-icon" src="/img/plus.svg" alt="">
            </button>
          </div>
          <div class="steps__collapsible-inner">
            <ol class="steps__small-list">
              <li>
                <p class="steps__p">Once you have logged into your account, on the ‘Sites’ tab you will see a green button with the ‘New site from Git’ label. Press it to add your website from its Git repo.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p class="steps__p">Sign in to your Git provider’s account when prompted.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p class="steps__p">Netlify will now display the available repositories. Pick the repository of the website that you want to publish.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p class="steps__p">Now you will be able to pick the branch you want Netlify to deploy your site from and the basic build settings. For example, Hugo uses the ‘hugo’ command to build the website, therefore the ‘Build Command’ setting will be set to ‘hugo’. You can also name the folder you want the site to publish into.</p>
                <p class="steps__p">Netlify works with some SSGs by default, therefore if you use Hugo, these settings will automatically be filled in for you.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p class="steps__p">Press the green ‘Deploy site’ button. Congratulations! Netlify will now run the build task and publish your website. If everything went well, your website will now be live.</p>
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p class="steps__p">You can now change the name of the website, which will also change the URL. You don’t need to do anything else from here. Every time a change is pushed to the Git repo of your site, Netlify will automatically rebuild and deploy it.</p>

    </ol>

<section class="ending wrapper">
  <h3 class="ending__heading">Thats it! 🎉</h3>
  <p class="ending__subheading">You now have a <span class="underlined">JAMstack</span> website</p>
  <p class="ending__text">You can also integrate a static Content Management System into your site if it's built with a static site generator, and some services make it extremely easy.</p>

    <h3>CMS Integration (Optional)</h3>
    <p class="steps__p">If you’re interested in adding a content management system to your website (and I recommend that you do, especially for blog sites), it’s a very simple process thanks to services like <a href="https://forestry.io/">Forestry CMS</a>.</p>
    <p class="steps__p steps__p--heading">This is what the process of integrating Forestry into a Hugo site looks like:</p>
    <ol class="steps__small-list">
      <li>
        <p class="steps__p">On the homepage of Forestry.io, press the ‘Import Your Site Now’ button, then create an account.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="steps__p">On the ‘My sites’ page, press the green ‘Add site’ button.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="steps__p">Choose the static site generator that your website uses and the version then press next.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="steps__p">Choose the Git provider you use and make sure that Quick Setup is checked on then press next.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p class="steps__p">Sign in to your Git account then select the repository and branch of your site then press next.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p class="steps__p">Forestry will now import your website and in a few short moments you site will have CMS functionality! You can now edit or add new pages amongst many other things. The steps to set this up were just as short and easy as linking a site with Netlify.</p>
    <p class="steps__p">You can find a list of CMSs on <a href="https://headlesscms.org/">headlesscms.org</a>.</p>
